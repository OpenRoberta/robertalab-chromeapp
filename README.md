# robertalab-chromeapp

### Description ###
This is an Application for the Chrome-browser and for Chromebooks. It connects your LEGO Mindstorms EV3 to Open Roberta Lab using the USB cable of the robot.
If you do not have a Local Wifi network available, this is the alternative to go with. Open Roberta Lab uses a custom firmware for the EV3, provided on a micro-SD card.

No additional driver required under Linux and Chrome OS.
Under Windows, you have to install the Windows generic RNDIS driver for the EV3 device.
Under Mac OS, you have to install the HoRNDIS driver.
Otherwise, the Open Roberta Lab Chrome App will not be able to detect the EV3.
